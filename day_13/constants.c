/* A string constant, or string literal is is a seq of zero or more chars surrounded in double quotes */

/* Enumeration constants is a list of constant int values: */
/* enum boolean { NO, YES }; */

/* constant declarations in array parameters indicate that the functions does not change the arr: */
